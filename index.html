Its beautiful quality and colour make it the most sought after metal when it comes to jewellery. That said, even gold jewellery won't do much for you if you don't consider how to style it.

Others may be too subdued and draw little if any attention to their jewellery choices. There are also those who wear the same pieces day in and day out, some of which may be lovely but they get lost in repetition (and I bet they need a good clean too!).
                                    
                                    When it comes to wearing gold jewellery especially, you'll really want to make the most of your investment and style it so you look your best when wearing it - and so that you show it off appropriately.
